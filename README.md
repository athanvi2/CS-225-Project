# CS225 Final Project - Open Flights

### Group members:
* Idrees Mohammed, imoha2
* Khatija Syeda, kasyeda2
* Zainab Sajid, zsajid2
* Abhi Thanvi, athanvi2

NEED TO DO: describe the physical location of all major files and deliverables (code, tests, data, the written report, the presentation video, etcâ€¦)

# How does our project work?
Our program uses data from [Open Flights](https://openflights.org/data.html) to find the shortest path between two airports.
We use BFS Traversal to find the shortest path from a starting airport to destination airport based on least amount of connected flights. We use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting airport to destination airport based on shortest numeric distance. NEED TO DO PAGERANK

Our presentation video: NEED TO DO
